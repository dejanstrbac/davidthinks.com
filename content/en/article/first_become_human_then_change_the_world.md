Many talk about world-changing ideas nowadays which throws many to daydreaming. However, it was never ideas that changed the world, but real individuals of flesh and bone. These persevering enlighteners sailed great hassles and some even paid with their lives in order to change well established beliefs.

The idea was never that important as much good insight into the reality of the big picture, benevolence, perseverance and strong beliefs as guidance. All those are well known traits of enlighteners we know from history.

Unfortunately, strong and persevering people are very rare. Benevolent are ever rarer. The change makers in human minds used to be geniuses, artists, writers and great tinkerers.

The situation is significantly different. As if with the sole fact that we are continuously getting more and more connected to each other by technology, we are far more distant, busier and confused than the previous generations, yet genuinely individual thought is all the rarer.

In the west, the changes are exclusively expected from entrepreneurs and the president. In the far east the gurus and mystics used to cultivate the human thought before the army took over and negated any development. And in the Balkans, as if in a practical joke, changes are foolishly expected from politicians.

As a result, the world sees fewer gurus and tinkerers, while all the more politicians, self-proclaimed entrepreneurs and soldiers.

The world cannot be to blame. The individuals are, each on its own. Where did things go so wrong that personal interest became main character guidance?

Great minds lived to create and give to others, while the small minds used to worry about themselves and their personal needs only. Where would this world be without the old greek and roman philosophers, Beethoven’s and Mozart's music, ingenuity of Da Vinci, the electricity of Nikola Tesla? None of them are glorified today for the products sold, earned or taken wealth but due to how much value they created for others.

Today we live and work to earn far more than we could ever need, for personal greed or financial success of a company. People used to be disgusted by those who loved and lived to count and glorify their gold, while the same are nowadays being glorified. It is as if greed became a virtue.

Entrepreneurs say that goal justifies means. But even if those means include suffering of others? Surely it is easy turning one's head away from those unknown others. It is no wonder that a man finds himself lonelier than ever in highly populated cities. Maybe people are afraid that if even someone got to know them, they would not like what they find out. They might just be right.

Capitalism is not to blame. People are more rotten but not aware of it. They simply do not have the time to understand own reality.

Capitalism is the de-facto established principle of the most developed world of today. It is certainly the best alternative as it (mostly) allows freedom of choice. However, capitalistic order convinces us that we first must work before giving birth to children; when children are born, they _must_ attend school so that one day they get jobs and join the capitalistic machinery which would close the circle.

When (and if) those children get jobs, they work to survive - pay expenses necessary to continue working. Personal life narrows down to the difference in the time and money that remains. To paint a different reality and encourage workers, many twist the truth with newly coined terms such as career, otherwise known carrot on a stick.

It sounds just unreal as a child game, especially reading amazing James Carse's [Finite and infinite games](http://www.amazon.com/Finite-Infinite-Games-James-Carse/dp/1476731713), a book worth reading over and over.

The question arises - where is the time for unrestricted creativity in such society, when there is not even time for free thoughts? Is it then even surprising that true enlighteners are long gone?

To go after a change in the world, one must start from oneself. As Mahatma Gandhi wisely said:

> Be the change you wish to see in the world.

World by itself has no adjectives, it simply - is. All beauty and ugliness of this world begins and ends within the eye of the observer. After all, the person itself chooses what will be seen or understood based on existing beliefs and prejudices. One sees evil where one good ad vice versa. Each clear-minded human believes in doing the best possible - but always according to some personal measures.

Most notorious persons in human history actually believed they were doing good. The problem is that they always wanted the best for themselves, consciously or unconsciously. Too bad that the same, which today do not deserve even being mentioned by name, did not use own passion and strength in benevolent purposes to leave this world at least a bit better than how they found it.

A wise man will recognise evil in own eyes, correct beliefs and kill prejudices for own sake.

The world will always need changes and people willing to conduct them. Future tinkerers are born every moment which will see the world differently than then previous.

However, before getting carried away for such ludicrous and highly noble task, one must question self for the necessary virtues. For whom shell the world change? Selfishly for own glory and well-being or for others for their chance to a slightly better world?
