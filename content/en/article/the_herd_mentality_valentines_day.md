They say Valentine's Day is the time to celebrate romance and love.

Unfortunatelly, just as Christmas, Valentine's Day as we know it today is mostly just a commercial phenomenon, and it comes with muddled origins.

While its meaning is fuzzier with every generation, rarely does one know the actual reason for celebration and gift giving. Gods Cupid, Eros, arrows hearts and flowers rush to mind. However, all those images have been planted in us by
the creatives of some advertising campaigns.

It is common sense that by spending money, one does not demonstrate love and appreciation. Furthermore, by spending money demonstrably around public observations, one may only demonstrate superficialty.

True affection is non materialistic and does not require a dedicated time or location. Then why do humans of all races and religions go wild on their wallets on Valentine's Day?

While we may all celebrate our differences, we should be honest how similar we truly are. We share the very same human traits which means also defects.

On Valentine's Day, we fall prÐµy to the herd mentality. We act more on our instincts than our reason.

In [The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind](http://www.amazon.com/Crowd-Study-Popular-Mind/dp/1502303264/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1455227593&sr=8-1), Gustav Le Bon concludes:

> an individual immersed for some length of time in a crowd soon finds himself - either in consequence of magnetic influence given out by the crowd or from some other cause of which we are ignorant - in a special state, which much resembles the state of fascination in which the hypnotized individual finds himself in the hands of the hypnotizer...

## The Actual Origins

Valentine's Day has its origins in a brutal Roman feast called [Lupercalia](http://www.britannica.com/topic/Lupercalia), celebrated mid-February. Skins of a sacrificed dog and goat would be used by men to whip women, which believed the ritual would make them fertile.

That would still not make it Valentine's day though.

Even though there were two executions of men named Valentine on the 14th of February, albeit in different years, there is no direct correlation to the today's meaning. Most likely due to a similar pronunciation, a Norman festivity "Galatin's Day" crossed roads with the above mentioned events to form the name of today.

__One should not celebrate if the reasons are not well understood.__

History matters.
