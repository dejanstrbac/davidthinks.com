Most popular email services nowadays are provided free of charge and boast amazing number of users. But as the Internet adage goes:

> If you are not paying for a product, you are the product.

Does that mean that our email addresses actually own us and not the other way around?

The situation reminds of the poker saying popularised by *Waren Buffet* in his [Letters to Shareholders](http://www.amazon.com/Berkshire-Hathaway-Letters-Shareholders-Buffett/dp/0615975070):

> If you’ve been in the game 30 minutes and don’t know who the patsy is, you’re it.

There is no such thing as free lunch. When something has an upfront price, the customer is in control and the compensation rules are obvious. The incentives are straight-forward on both sides. The transparency and disclosure is required by the financial transaction itself.

However, when it comes to "free" services, it is still obvious to all users that they still pay somehow, although it remains unclear with exactly *what*. Whether it is giving up privacy, tracking, logged, analyzis, observation, having messages read by humans or machines, it remains at sole discretion of the service provider. After all, the users bring their content (emails) to them.

As a result, most of the discussions and concerns bring up issues of privacy.

However, there is another part of the picture that should be of much higher concern.

Obviously all free email providers utilize their own domains for the email addresses issued. Changing the provider means losing the current email address. When someone uses a given email address for years, it is far from trivial just changing to another. Therefore, if unsatisfied with the provider at some point, for most users there is no other choice but to abide.

This situation creates a strong [vendor lock-in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in), making it very hard or impossible to switch without significant costs.

Owning a email address on an own domain not only looks professional, but it also gives full control over email. One can self-host or use a third party provider. If not satisfied with the email service vendor, changing to another is trivial and well documented by every provider. Best of all, the email address can remain the same no matter what tomorrow brings.

So why do people still use free email addresses?

One reason is certainly apparent simplicity. The other, more interesting, are in the [herd mentality](the_herd_mentality_valentines_day.html) and fallacy of [Argumentum ad populum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum):

> everyone is doing it, so it must be good

*Rolf Dobelli* observed Argumentum ad populum and other similar fallacies in his highly recommended book [The Art of Thinking Clearly](http://www.amazon.com/The-Thinking-Clearly-Rolf-Dobelli/dp/0062219693).

Free email used to be a popular choice a decade ago, when hosting own email addresses was expensive, complicated and mostly reserved for big companies. Today however, situation has drastically changed. Taking full control of personal communications is easy and monthly costs are comparable to that of a cup of coffee.

Most important, we should trust our own reason rather then rely on popular _(non)_ choices.
